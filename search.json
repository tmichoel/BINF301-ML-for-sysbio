    "text": "This is the website for the second half of the course BINF301 Genome-scale Algorithms. This part of the course focuses on machine learning algorithms for analyzing genome-scale data.\nMachine learning plays an important role in computational biology. See the Machine Learning in Computational and Systems Biology community or the Machine Learning in Computational Biology conference series.\nThe lectures are divided in modules, each focusing on a specific class of methods:\n\nClustering\nRegularized regression\nDimensionality reduction\nCausal inference\nGraphical models\nSpatio-Temporal models\n\nEach module follows the same structure:\n\nA classic or ground-breaking biological or biomedical research paper is studied where the algorithm (or class of algorithms) of interest was used.\nThe method used in the paper is studied in detail, along with additional methods to solve the same type of problem.\nThe methods are put in practice using, where possible, original data from the papers studied in the first part.\n\nThe computational demonstrations for the course were developed in Julia, and the course starts with an introduction to Julia. For the assignments, you can use any programming language.\nAn appendix contains the minimum required background knowledge on gene regulation, probability theory, linear algebra, and optimization.\nThe theoretical sections contain the basic information to understand a method, pointing to relevant sections of the following textbooks (with free pdfs!) for details:\n\nTrevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. The Elements of Statistical Learning (second edition) (2009).\nGareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (2023).\nChristopher Bishop. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (2006).\nMarc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. Mathematics for Machine Learning (2020).\n\nThe use of classic papers is motivated by Back to the future: education for systems-level biologists. Since the field of genome-scale data analysis is still relatively young, the choice of papers for study is still a bit open and likely to evolve as the course matures."

    "text": "Book sections\n\n\n\n\nElements of Statistical Learning: Section 14.2\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning: Section 12.4\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe goal of cluster analysis is to group or segment a collection of objects into subsets or “clusters”, such that objects within a cluster are more closely related than objects in different clusters.\nMany datasets exhibit a hierarchical structure, with no clear demarcation of clusters, and clusters can themselves be grouped successively such that clusters within one group are more similar than those in different groups. Deciding where to make the “cut” is usually done by setting parameters of a clustering algorithm, and almost always involves an arbitrary choice by the user.\nCentral to all clustering methods is the notion of the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) between the objects being clustered. Sometimes data are presented directly in terms of proximity/similarity between objects. More often we have measurements (e.g. gene expression) on objects (e.g. genes or samples) that we want to cluster, and a (dis)similariy matrix must be constructed first.\n\n\nQuestions and problems for discussion\n\nDissimilarity measures\nAssume we have measurements \\(x_{ij}\\) for objects \\(i=1,2,\\dots,N\\) on variables (or attributes) \\(j=1,2,\\dots,p\\). Usually, we first define a dissimilarity function \\(d_j(x_{ij},x_{i'j})\\) between values of the \\(j\\)th attribute. How is the dissimilarity between objects defined and how can we vary the relative influence of a given attribute in the overall dissimilarity between objects?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo give all attributes equal influence in the object dissimilarity, we must set their relative weights to \\(w_j\\sim 1/\\overline{d_j}\\), with\n\\[\n\\overline{d_j}=\\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N  \\sum_{i'=1}^N d_j(x_{ij},x_{i'j})\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nSetting \\(w_j=1\\) for all \\(j\\) does not necessarily give all attributes equal influence! To see this, compute the average object dissimilarity over all pairs of objects. It should be a sum over attributes, and attributes have equal influence in the object dissimilarity if their contribution to this sum is one. Show that this results in the equation above.\n\n\nThe most common choice of dissimilarity function is squared-error distance:\n\\[\nd_j(x_{ij},x_{i'j}) = (x_{ij}-x_{i'j})^2\n\\]\nDefine the mean and variance of each attribute over all objects as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mu_j &= \\frac1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_{ij}\\\\\\\\\n\\sigma_j^2 &= \\frac1N \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{ij}-\\mu_j)^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nShow that with squared-error distance, the average object dissimilarity on the \\(j\\)th attribute is proportional to its variance.\n\n\nIt is often recommended to standardize data before clustering:\n\\[\nx_{ij} \\to y_{ij}=\\frac{x_{ij}-\\mu_j}{\\sigma_j}\n\\]\nWith squared-error loss, this is equivalent to setting weights \\(w_j \\sim 1/\\sigma_j^2 \\sim 1/\\bar{d}_j\\), that is, to give all attributes equal influence on the average object dissimilarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSometimes some attributes exhibit more grouping tendency than others, which may be obscured by standardizing. Find and understand the figure in the book sections above that illustrates this. The solution is to filter attributes by their variance before standardizing, and only use attributes with high variance for clustering. Why?\n\n\n\n\nCombinatorial clustering\nCombinatorial clustering algorithms assign each object to a cluster without regard to a probability model describing the data. Understanding combinatorial clustering is a necessary basis for understanding probabilistic methods.\nIn combinatorial clustering, a prespecified number of clusters \\(K&lt;N\\) is postulated (\\(N\\) the number of objects). An assignment of objects \\(i\\in\\{1,\\dots,N\\}\\) to clusters \\(k\\in\\{1,\\dots,K\\}\\) is charcterized by a many-to-one mapping or encoder \\(k=C(i)\\).\n\\(C\\) is obtained by minimizing the “within cluster” point scatter \\(W(C)\\), which characterizes the extent to which objects assigned to the same cluster tend to be close to one another. How is \\(W(C)\\) defined?\nWe can also define the “between cluster” point scatter \\(B(C)\\), which characterizes the extent to which objects assigned to different clusters tend to be far apart. How is \\(B(C)\\) defined?\nDoes it matter whether we find an optimal clustering by minimizing \\(W(C)\\) or by maximizing \\(B(C)\\)? Hint: compute \\(W(C)+B(C)\\).\n\n\nK-means clustering\nThe \\(K\\)-means algorithm uses the squared Euclidean distance \\[\nd(x_i,x_{i'}) = \\sum_{j=1}^p (x_{ij}-x_{i'j})^2 = \\\\| x_i - x_{i'}\\\\|^2\n\\] and an iterative greedy descent algorithm to minimize \\(W(C)\\).\nUsing the Euclidean distance expression, find an expression for \\(W(C)\\) in terms of the number of objects assigned to cluster \\(k\\) and the mean vector associated to cluster \\(k\\).\nShow that \\(W(C)\\) is minimized if within each cluster, the average dissimilarity of the objects from the cluster mean, as defined by the points in that cluster, is minimized.\nNote that for any set of objects \\(S\\), \\[\n\\overline{x_S} = \\frac{1}{|S|} \\sum_{i\\in S} x_i = \\text{argmin}_m \\sum_{i\\in S}\\\\|x_i-m\\\\|^2\n\\]\nFind out how this result is used in a greedy descent algorithm where alternatingly the mean vectors are updated for the current cluster assignments, and object assignments are updated by assigning objects to the nearest current mean vector.\n\n\nHow do we choose the number of clusters K?\nFind the recommended method in the book sections above."
