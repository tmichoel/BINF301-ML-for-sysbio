### Motivation

Reducing high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional representation for the purposes of visualization and pattern discovery is a classical approach in statistics, with [principal component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) probably the best known method. PCA and other dimension reduction methods have been used in systems biology for as long as (relatively) large data have been around. Nowadays, dimension reduction plays is mostly associated with the analysis of [single-cell sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_sequencing) data. Given the importance of [single-cell sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_sequencing) data analysis at the moment, and the relative lack of understanding of the [non-linear dimension reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction) methods that are regularly employed in this context, this will be our angle for learning about dimension reduction.

For our path-breaking paper, we select a relatively early study of cell types in the brain using [single-cell sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_sequencing) of 622 mouse neurons. In this study, PCA is used to visualize data in two and three dimensions and to identify distinct types of sensory neurons.

To illustrate how far the field of [single-cell sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_sequencing) has advanced in the last decade, we select a paper from the [BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/tools-and-technologies-brain-cells-and-circuits/brain-initiative-cell-census-network), which sequenced more than three million human brain cells, including more than two million neurons. Here, [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) and [UMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Uniform_manifold_approximation_and_projection) are used for dimension reduction, as as the case in most current studies in the field.
