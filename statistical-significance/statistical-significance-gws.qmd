### Motivation

Is it statistics or is it machine learning? Does it matter? [Storey and Tibshirani's paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1530509100) can rightfully claim to have changed the field of statistical learning. It has been cited more than 10,000 times and its results are now included in all textbooks in the field. Every student wishing to analyze genome-scale data must understand what [q-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-value_(statistics)) and [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate) mean.

With a paper of this standing, it can seem exaggerated to ask for a test of time. We look at a paper from the [GTEx project](https://www.gtexportal.org/) to show how the multiple testing problem has exploded far beyond the scale considered in [Storey and Tibshirani's paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1530509100), but can still be adequately addressed using their method. We also look at a recent methodological paper, to show there is always scope for new ideas, even for something as well established as [Storey and Tibshirani's method](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1530509100).

### Questions for discussion

We cover the following parts:

- Abstract
- Example 1, differentially expressed genes
- Table 1
- What is a p-value?
- What is the FDR?
- Derivation that p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis
- Figure 1
- FDR estimation
- Figure 2
- What is a q-value?
