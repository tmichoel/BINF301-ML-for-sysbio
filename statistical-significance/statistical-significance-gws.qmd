## Path-breaking paper: Statistical significance for genomewide studies

## Path-breaking  paper

Storey, John D., and Robert Tibshirani. ["Statistical significance for genomewide studies."](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1530509100) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 100.16 (2003): 9440-9445.

### Introduction



### Questions for discussion

We cover the following parts:

- Abstract
- Example 1, differentially expressed genes
- Table 1
- What is a p-value?
- What is the FDR?
- Derivation that p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis
- Figure 1
- FDR estimation
- Figure 2
- What is a q-value?

## Test of time

Q-values and FDR estimation have changed the entire field of statistics, passing the test of time doesn't get any better than for this paper.

To illustrate how the number of tests in genome-wide studies has exploded after 2003, see the GTEx paper, which uses q-values to control for multiple testing:
